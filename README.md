I am a Computing Science graduate who recently graduated from the University of Alberta, with a strong academic foundation and practical experience in data
analysis, software development, and productivity tools. I hold a Google Data Analytics
Professional Certificate and an AWS Cloud Practitioner Certificate, and have applied my
skills in academic projects and personal initiatives. I am now seeking full-time opportunities—whether in data science, administrative support, customer service, or community engagement—where I can contribute meaningfully, build on my hands-on experience, and grow within a supportive team environment. Known for being detail-oriented, tech-savvy, and collaborative, I take pride in supporting others and delivering high-quality results.
